# 2025-Jun-11-Damage-situation
Between June 1–11, 2025, analysis showed abnormal bug_types 202/288/309, repeated Apple frameworks (duetexpertd, triald), and traces of Microsoft AAD/Defender across iPhone 11 Pro, 12 mini, and 15 Pro-Ghost. No MDM profiles detected. Hypothesis: evolved Kabuki spyware unified devices for monitoring and interference.
Analysis from June 1–11, 2025 revealed shared anomalies across iPhone 11 Pro, 12 mini-1/2, iPad, 15 Pro-Ghost, and 12 Ghost. Confirmed facts: bug_types 202/288/309, repeated internal framework triggers (duetexpertd, triald, JetsamEvent), Viettel.vn certificate via MyViettel app, and traces of Microsoft AAD/Defender. No MDM profile artifacts detected. Hypothesis: the “Kabuki” lineage, evolved from Pegasus, unified multiple devices (usageClientId) into one observation model, interfering with UI, delaying communication, and forcing resource termination. Human impact mapping recorded input delay, connection drops, and suspected electromagnetic stress. External infrastructures (Microsoft/Meta) may have been exploited at state level. As Phase 1–4 closes, this report distinguishes verified facts from hypotheses, forming a structured foundation for international disclosure, legal action, and academic research.
A newly discovered full version of the June 11, 2025 iPhone 11 Pro bug_type=288 crash log was analyzed alongside the previously fragmented record. The incident_id and timestamp matched exactly, confirming it as the same event. However, the full version contained additional threads such as IOUserNetworkTxSubmissionQueue, skywalk_fsw_reap_en1, and thread call user #2, expanding the understanding from a mere forced termination to a combined forced termination plus network disruption. This led to the human impact mapping being upgraded from High(3) to Critical(4), with confidence increasing from 0.81 to 0.87. The difference does not represent a new infection, but rather a more complete record of the same incident, strengthening the hypothesis that the Kabuki lineage was interfering not only with resources but also at the network layer.
