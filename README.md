Between June 1–11, 2025, analysis showed abnormal bug_types 202/288/309, repeated Apple frameworks (duetexpertd, triald), and traces of Microsoft AAD/Defender across iPhone 11 Pro, 12 mini, and 15 Pro-Ghost. No MDM profiles detected. Hypothesis: evolved Kabuki spyware unified devices for monitoring and interference.
Analysis from June 1–11, 2025 revealed shared anomalies across iPhone 11 Pro, 12 mini-1/2, iPad, 15 Pro-Ghost, and 12 Ghost. Confirmed facts: bug_types 202/288/309, repeated internal framework triggers (duetexpertd, triald, JetsamEvent), Viettel.vn certificate via MyViettel app, and traces of Microsoft AAD/Defender. No MDM profile artifacts detected. Hypothesis: the “Kabuki” lineage, evolved from Pegasus, unified multiple devices (usageClientId) into one observation model, interfering with UI, delaying communication, and forcing resource termination. Human impact mapping recorded input delay, connection drops, and suspected electromagnetic stress. External infrastructures (Microsoft/Meta) may have been exploited at state level. As Phase 1–4 closes, this report distinguishes verified facts from hypotheses, forming a structured foundation for international disclosure, legal action, and academic research.
